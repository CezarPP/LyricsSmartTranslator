    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        PoST is a website for reading, writing and commenting on poems translations in different languages.
        PoST is based on Project 6 (Poem Smart Translator), but instead of poems (with the agreement from our seminar
        teacher) it uses song lyrics instead of poems. The website allows the user to make an account and then add new
        songs, translations, comment, share and make annotations on the side of songs. It also displays charts and
        rankings with the most popular translations or the most active users. Moreover, the newest translations are
        available via an RSS feed. In this first part of the project, only the front-end was created.

    <h2>Website features</h2>
    <p>
        Post is a complex website that offers users a lot of useful functionalities that help them learn about new songs
        and make contributing with new translations or songs very easy.
    </p>

    <p> The most important elements of the website are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Navbar</li>
        <li>Main page</li>
        <li>Search page</li>
        <li>Song page</li>
        <li>Add song page</li>
        <li>Add translation page</li>
        <li>Login page</li>
        <li>Profile page</li>
        <li>Other pages</li>
        <li>Design elements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Navbar</h3>
    <p>The website navbar remains consistent across all pages, featuring a straightforward menu that
        facilitates simple navigation for the user. The menu contains buttons that lead to different parts of the
        website (Featured, Charts, Search, Add Song, Login/User page). It is very responsive, so when the screen is
        narrower than a set threshold, it transforms into a dropdown menu accessible by pressing the icon in the top
        right corner.
    </p>

    <h3>Main page</h3>
    <p>The main page is accessible, at any time, by pressing the logo on the navbar.
        It contains a list of the newest translations/songs available on the website in the FEATURED section. Each piece
        of news has a title, an author, and a picture of the album from where the song originates.
    </p>
    <p>Under the FEATURED section, the user can use the search bar to search for songs that are available on the
        website.
        The search bar can autocomplete and offers suggestions based on string prefix matching. The user can choose one
        of the suggestions by using the keyboard arrows and pressing enter to make a selection. Upon pressing the
        "Submit" button, the user will be sent to the search page where the results of the search will be listed, and
        where the user can execute more searches.

    </p>Under the search bar in sections "CHARTS" and "COMMUNITY" a user can view useful statistics about the site
    activity.
    In the "CHARTS" sections, by selecting criteria from the dropdown button from the left, the user can find out which
    are the most viewed, commented, and liked songs from the webpage. The "COMMUNITY" sections will contain a table with
    the most active page
    contributions.
    It will contain the accounts that added the most translations.
    <p>

    <h3>Search page</h3>
    <p>The search page is accessible, at any time, by pressing the button from the navbar or by using the search bar on
        the main page.
        It will contain search results and enable the user to move to the desired song page.
    </p>

    <h3>Song page</h3>
    <p>The song page is one of the most complex pages on the website. To access a certain song page, a user can click on
        any link on the main page from "FEATURES" and "CHARTS" or by using the search bar from the main page or the
        search page.
    </p>
    <p>It is composed of the following sections:</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Song header</h4>
    <p>The song header contains the album image from where the song is from, the title, the singer/band, and a short
        description.
        In the separate section on the right, there is information such as the user who posted the translation, the date
        when the translation was added, and the number of views, comments, and likes. The language of the song can be
        changed by using the dropdown button. Upon selecting another language, the lyrics, description, and other
        elements on the page will be changed to the desired language. A user can add a translation by pressing the "Add
        translation" button which will transfer the user to add translation page. A website visitor can share the
        translation by pressing the Tumblr and WordPress icons.
    </p>
    <h4>Song Lyrics</h4>
    <p>The user can make annotations by selecting a portion of the text.
        Once the user selects the text he/she wants to annotate, a box appears on the right side of the screen.
        This prompt has space for entering the text of the annotation and has 2 buttons. The submit and the cancel
        button.
        The user can also make the annotation box disappear by clicking away.
        Once the user clicks the submit button, the annotated text will be highlighted in gray.
        From then on, the user will be able to click the highlighted text and see/edit the annotation.
        He will be able to do so from another annotation box that has edit and save buttons.
        This annotation box also contains a share button allowing the user to share said annotation.</p>

    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>In the About section, the user can read the full description of the song. Moreover, if the song is on YouTube,
        the visitor
        can play the song and watch the music video without leaving the website</p>

    <h4>Comment sections</h4>
    <p> In the comments section, the user can write personal opinions about the song or the translations or read other
        people comments </p>


    <h3>Add song page</h3>
    <p>The add song page can be accessed from the navbar. It enables the user to add a new song by writing the title,
        author, lyrics, and description a providing an image and a YouTube link</p>

    <h3>Add translation page</h3>
    <p>The add translation page is available from the song page. It is similar to the add song page, but the user can
        only add the translated lyrics and description.</p>

    <h3>Login page</h3>
    <p>The login page is available from the navbar. If the user does not have an account he can create one, by using the
        registration form.</p>

    <h3>Profile page</h3>
    <p>The profile page is available from the navbar after the user is logged in. It contains the user's profile
        picture, username, and password and enables the user to change all of them.
        Moreover, it shows some users' stats such as the number of translations, annotations, comments, and songs added.
    </p>

    <h3>Other pages</h3>
    <p>This refers to less frequently visited pages such as "About", "Help", and "Contact"</p>

    <h3>Design elements</h3>
    <p>We spent a lot of time debating the colour palette and the general look of the website. In the end we settled on warm and cool colors
        that make the user experience on the website more pleasant.</p>

    <h2>Used technologies</h2>
    <p>To make frontend component of this website we used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also included schemas which are used by search engines and other applications to understand and display
        content more intelligently, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for.
    </p>
    <p>We used JavaScript for the search bar, annotations on the song page and most of the buttons.</p>
    <p>We tried our hand at BEM and SASS but unfortunately, due to lack of time we did not manage to incorporate them in the project.</p>
