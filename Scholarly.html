    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Liryt is a website for reading, writing and commenting on poems tranlations in different languages.
        It is based on Project 6 (Poem Smart Translator), but instead of poems (with the agreement from our seminar
        teacher)
        it uses song lyrics instead of poems. The website offers the user the abbility to make an account and then
        add new songs, add translations, comment, share and make addnotations on the side of every song. It also
        displays
        different charts and rankings with the most popular translations or the most active users. Moreover, the newest
        translations
        are available via a RSS feed. In this first part of the project only the front-end was created.
