        <h2>Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            We chose to implement the "Poem Smart Translator" project,
            not only because we liked its idea, we thought it would provide us with ample opportunities to learn about
            RSS, interaction with APIs such as Tumbler's and WordPress'.
